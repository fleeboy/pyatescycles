For over 5 years I have been on your side of the EllisLab / Community relationship so it is still a bit strange having been absorbed into the matrix, but so far so good (did I mention they have cookies?). As you have probably heard I was hired to bring an Enterprise Level of services to EllisLab for those working with ExpressionEngine. I would like to take this opportunity to say that if you are a developer that regularly works on Enterprise level work; or if you are a direct client and have a reason to be interested in Enterprise Services I would love to hear from you.</p>

<p>Now, on to some other exciting stuff! This week Leslie Camacho, Leslie Doherty, Greg Aker and myself will be attending <a href="http://sxsw.com">SxSW</a> in the hopes of meeting up with community members. So if you are going to be there make sure to check in on the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/#!/event.php?eid=158751037513904">FaceBook page for the Meet-up</a>. Also make sure to let us know in the forum thread for this blog post in case you are not able to attend that gathering.</p>

<p>If you have something you want to discuss that you think warrants a private meeting with any of the four of us then just send the person you want to meet with an email. This week is mostly about meeting with you and carrying any thoughts you may have back into the matrix.</p>

You now have all the power and flexibility of SafeCracker at your fingertips for your existing and future ExpressionEngine projects (did we mention it&#8217;s free?).</p>

<p>What is SafeCracker? For those of you who are not familiar with this add-on, it was originally created by the CartThrob team at Barrett Newton, Inc.&nbsp; From the Barrett Newton team: &#8220;SafeCracker is a replacement and enchancement of ExpressionEngine’s Stand Alone Entry Form. SafeCracker makes it possible to add and edit your site’s content without accessing the backend. This allows you to push the boundaries of ExpressionEngine design and development, create rich web applications, and simplify your development process.&#8221;</p>

<p>We’ll be working diligiently to integrate SafeCracker into ExpressionEngine&#8217;s native feature set. If there are specific ways you&#8217;d like to see SafeCracker integrated, don&#8217;t be shy, tell us on the forums, Twitter, Facebook, or your blog and let us know about it. </p>

<p>EllisLab will support SafeCracker directly through the <a href="http://expressionengine.com/forums">Support Forums</a> (like we do for all First Party add-ons). The team at Barrett Newton will continue to assist EllisLab during the transition to provide the smoothest possible release. </p>

<p>I just wanted to remind y&#8217;all of three quick bits of important information:</p>

<p>1. The Fusion Ads holiday bundle is <a href="https://fusionads.net/bundle/closed">now closed</a>. I&#8217;m very sorry if you missed out on the opportunity. You can still purchase <a href="https://secure.expressionengine.com/">ExpressionEngine</a> at our store, though. Wink.</p>

<p>2. Fusion Ads licenses <a href="http://expressionengine.com/fusion/">become active on January 10th, 2011</a>. We did that because we liked the way the date looked when we wrote it out. No, I&#8217;m kidding. We have been catching up as quickly as we can to give everyone the best possible support and the attention you deserve. We&#8217;re gearing up to answer your questions if you&#8217;re new to the community or need help getting going with your new Freelancer license. On January 10th, you&#8217;ll also have the option to upgrade your license if you already hold an existing Freelancer license.</p>

<p>(Honestly, am I the only person that gets giddy at binary dates? Like 11011 for the Fusion Ads bundle activation date? That&#8217;s an MD5 checksum of f616c83f2f0f188265c7004d81d45723 or the number 27. DaVinci&#8217;s code holds nothing on me.)</p>

<p>This morning, we have released a new version to fix some critical bugs in ExpressionEngine 2.1.2. This includes fixes for the Discussion Forum module.</p>

<p>You can read about these updates in our <a href="http://expressionengine.com/user_guide/changelog.html#v213">ExpressionEngine Change Log</a> and <a href="http://expressionengine.com/user_guide/modules/forum/changelog.html#v312">Discussion Forum Change Log</a></p>

<p>This is a required <a href="http://expressionengine.com/user_guide/installation/update.html">ExpressionEngine version update</a> for sites running 2.1.2, as well as <a href="http://expressionengine.com/user_guide/modules/forum/forum_update.html">Forum Version Update</a> for Discussion Forum module users.</p>

<p>I apologize for the inconvenience these bugs have created for sites that updated to 2.1.2.</p>

We&#8217;re proud to be part of the <a href="https://fusionads.net/bundle/">Fusion Ads Holiday Bundle</a>. Chris Bowler, Co-Founder at Fusion Ads, came to us with this wonderful idea of creating a software package aimed specifically at developers and designers. With so much support over the years from the web development community, we wanted to take this opportunity to give back a little.</p>

<p>This amazing package includes our Freelancer license. You&#8217;ll find software for designing, organizing, developing, and learning. We&#8217;ll send out EE Freelancer codes on January 10th. We hope you havea great holiday season. We&#8217;re looking forward to bringing in 2011 with you. </p>

<p><strong>You have questions, we have answers</strong></p>

<p>Here are some of the Frequently Asked Questions regarding this bundle.</p>

<p><strong>Can I upgrade my Freelancer License to a Commercial one?</strong> YES! You can upgrade in our store, after January 10th, 2011, by selecting the &#8220;upgrade to commercial&#8221; option for $200.</p>

<p><strong>What if I already have a Freelancer license and I don&#8217;t need it?</strong> Why not participate in a give-away like some of our staff are? That&#8217;s right, the bundle sounds good to us, too. Some of us couldn&#8217;t wait to get our paws on the software. But since we already have access to a freelancer license (perks of the job here) we want to share that with you!</p>

<p>Several of our staff are participating with give-aways. If you&#8217;d like to try to win a freelancer license, please participate!</p>

<p><strong>What if I want to give away a Freelancer license, too?</strong> Excellent! We&#8217;ll promote that for you in our forums. Please place your site and link to your give-away in <a href="http://expressionengine.com/forums/viewthread/176164/">the forum</a>. Have fun with it! Maybe you&#8217;ll make new friends. (And clients)</p>

<p><strong>What is this Coupon Code for and what do I do with it?</strong><br />
In order to get your license on January 10, 2011, you&#8217;ll need an ExpressionEngine user account. <a href="http://expressionengine.com/forums/member/register">Register here</a>. You&#8217;ll need the coupon code you receive in the Fusion Ad bundle to place it in the correct field.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re already a member, you&#8217;ll find the coupon code field in your &#8220;<a href="http://expressionengine.com/forums/member/edit_profile/#custom">Edit Profile</a>&#8221; area. Fill in the appropriate box so we are sure to get the license to you, even if you choose to upgrade later.</p>

<p><strong>Can I get a copy early?</strong><br />
We do not have a demo or free version for download. However, while you enjoy some holiday festivities, you&#8217;ll get a head start on the Ins and Outs of ExpressionEngine with <a href="http://expressionengine.com/fusion/">these tools</a>.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever tried to modify our control panel themes, you know it can be an arduous task. Handing off a tweaked control panel to a client meant taking our default theme files, duplicating them completely and modifying just that one bit you needed to change. While this worked, it was inefficient and difficult to maintain, requiring you to constantly keep your customized theme in-step with ExpressionEngine’s oft-improving stock theme.</p>

<p>ExpressionEngine 2.1.2 introduces cascading control panel themes. Simply put, your tweaked theme need now only consist of the files you’ve actually modified. Let’s say you want to tweak a bit of markup on the Publish page for your client. Just create a new theme folder, let’s call it “my_theme”, and drop your modified publish.php into the my_theme/content folder. Voilà! No other files or folders required. Anything you haven’t provided will be automatically fetched from the default theme.</p>

<p>Cascading control panel themes also means that our Corporate and Fruit themes are now nothing more than CSS and images. The end result? An even leaner and meaner ExpressionEngine, with a faster and more robust control panel for you and your clients.
